This website is built with blogdown, a R package developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/) and the theme is [hugo-paged](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-paged). I used theme [hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy) in old website, it is also a good theme and I modified some configure and stored it in my github. If you want to create a personal website, you could check out yihui's website as reference. While the website of [Jingji Pang](https://jinjipang.com/), [lijin Zhang](https://lijinzhang.com/) and [huang guozheng](https://guozheng.rbind.io/also) gives me a lot of inspiration, you can also check out their website.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Ecology from South China Agricultural University in 2023. I worked for one year after graduation. Currently, I am a master's student at City University of Hong Kong, majoring in Energy and Environment.
