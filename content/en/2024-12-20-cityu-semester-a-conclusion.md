> The Semester A ended. It is quit short, but I still learnt something useful in the limited time.

## Build Personal Website 
I spent about one week to roughly build my personal website and writing some simple blogs. I met many problems when building the website, but the [AI of POE](https://poe.com/) helped me to solve these problems and others' websites also gave me a lot of references. Websites I recommend: https://yihui.org/, https://jinjipang.com/, https://lijinzhang.com/. I modified the CSS and some specific HTML files to achieve what my website looks like now. 

I like the simple style because it can make me catch the important things easily. Maybe I will continue to add or correct something to make the website look better in the future, but now I think I should focus on the contents. 

## Acquire New Skills
- Using Latex to make my résumé, although I used the template, I learned the basic usage of Latex, and I will continue to study it. I see some articles online saying Latex is fading away. But I think it is necessary to learn if you are a master's student or PhD candidate.
- Learnt spatial analysis in Python. The elementary data manipulation and map drawing.
- R programming skills. I know the basic manipulation in the undergraduate period. Now, I am more familiar with R.
- Basic statistical knowledge. Distribution and test.
- Tools to demonstrate and record.
  - Presentation: for myself, Beamer in Latex ([overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)); Quarto or [litedown](https://github.com/yihui/litedown)(a new package developed by [yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)) in R to create an HTML file as PPT. For a group, PowerPoint may be a better choice to collaborate with group members.
  - PDF files: using Quarto to finish small assignments. But *LaTex* may be better to write an article.

## Overview of Master's Course Content

Five classes in semester A. 

- Environmental Assessment. The course mainly teaches how to write a research proposal. 
  - **Literature Review.** <u>*Research Background:*</u> introduce existed problem or methods. <u>*Research Question:*</u> What question you want to solve or research? The potential contribution you can make. <u>*Research Gap:*</u> Why this research? Reading articles related to the topic which you want to study, and finding which ideas can improve or address new ideas. <u>*Research Key conception:*</u> Some key concepts in the research should be explained, and connect each conception that appeared in the proposal.
- Environmental and Energy Policy.
  - The course mainly introduce the economy concept.
- Climate Change: Science, Adaptation, and Mitigation.
  - Global warming, climate change, climate variability. Climate feedback, Adaptation, mitigation. Adaptation prepares for natural disasters; mitigation aims to reduce emissions.
- Environmental Engineering Science. Traditional physics and chemistry course.
- Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development. From the formation of oil and coal to production of energy to solar energy and cleaner energy. It mainly conveyed concepts of energy. 

## Perspectives on the Master's Programme in Hong Kong

In conclusion, I think the master's programme in Hong Kong is unsuitable for those who want to continue to pursue PhD degree (but still have some opportunities). It is mainly for seeking jobs. But you can get enough spare time to develop skills you are interested in or enjoy the last school vibe before you embark on your career. I would prefer to apply for a PhD program instead of a job, and if I could go back to June, I would make a different choice. 

The reasons for choosing to study in Hong Kong are complex. Anyway, I made my choice and have to accept the consequences, whatever they may be. While it is natural to feel regret, we shouldn't dwell on it. Life is moving forward, and all I can do is focus on self-improvement and actively seek new opportunities. Let us keep fighting and moving, and never give up.
