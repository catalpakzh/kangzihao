This is Kang Zihao's personal website. I was born in Taihe, Jiangxi province. Currently, I am a master’s student at City University of Hong Kong (Thanks to my family’s support), majoring in Energy and Environment. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Ecology from South China Agricultural University in 2023. After graduation, I worked at the BYD as a procurement engineer for one year. This website is created for me to record the story I am making up, and also some random thoughts. I plan to use English to record some professional skills and Chinese to write down my thoughts. You can visit the list page of a single section by language, e.g., English, or Chinese.

这里是康梓豪的个人主页，我是江西人，在吉安市的一个小县城长大。本科毕业于华南农业大学资源环境学院，毕业后在比亚迪工作一年之后，现在香港城市大学能源与环境学院继续学习。我很喜欢雪，但是至今没有去过北方，很想有机会能去北方看一场雪。喜欢足球，但是没有踢过一次球。比起爬山，更喜欢看海；比起热闹，更喜欢安静。闲暇之余，喜欢玩日麻，读小说，看影评，也是一名游戏爱好者。
